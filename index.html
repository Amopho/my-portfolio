                  I’m an expert in my field but I wouldn’t be where I am without
                  those who've helped me along the way. That’s why I love
                  connecting with like-minded people and using my passion and
                  skills to make a difference.

                  I am a P.h.D. in Animal Science specialized in animal
                  nutrition and quality of feed materials. In 2020 I got a
                  fantastic opportunity to join a web development training and
                  as a result, it enabled me to add programming skills to my
                  researcher's toolkit. Please, join me in my journey of making
                  animal feed a better more balanced remedy for caring for our
                  four-legged friends as well as helping our planet to have it
                  easier with us humans living on her surface.

              <p>
                Hi there! As an animal scientist, I have written my Ph.D. thesis
                in this field. During my candidature, I have faced multiple
                challenges in researching animal physiology of nutrition, as
                well as the nutritional value of feeds and raw materials. I also
                had the privilege of teaching students of animal breeding and
                veterinary on domestic animals' physiology of nutrition, the
                nutritional value of feeds and raw materials as well as diverse
                nutritional systems. Here is to present and share what I
                mastered during my academic life. And I’ve been learning ever
                since.
